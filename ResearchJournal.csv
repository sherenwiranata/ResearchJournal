left,Alice in Wonderland,"Literary classic, UK/US","Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland is a literary classic first published in 1865, long before its famous Disney adaptations in animated and live-action form. The story follows a young girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world filled with bizarre characters, illogical happenings, and surreal landscapes. This whimsical world is ruled by dream-logic, where time bends, animals talk, and reason dissolves into nonsense. At its heart, Alice in Wonderland explores themes of identity, transformation, and absurdity through a playful, sometimes unsettling lens. The world Alice enters is both imaginative and unpredictable, often bordering on chaotic. While often remembered for its fun and childlike wonder, it also contains darker undertones that reflect confusion, fear, and the disorientation of growing up.  

I’m particularly drawn to the emotional contrast in Alice in Wonderland, how it balances playful surrealism with feelings of foreignness and unease. The characters, from the Cheshire Cat to the Queen of Hearts, are iconic not only for their appearance but for the peculiar psychological tone they create. This liminal and eerie quality, where everything feels off but has a beautiful outer appearance, gives a feeling of fakery. In my own work, I want to evoke a similar sense of trippy wonder, something that feels like a dream, but also like a space you’re not quite supposed to be in. I’m inspired by the way Carroll’s world suspends logic while still feeling emotionally coherent, and I hope to channel that balance of whimsy and eeriness in my final project.",./img/aliceinwonderland.png,,"Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll",,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland,#Concept, 
left,Camille Utterback,"Interactive media artist, USA","Camille Utterback is a media artist whose interactive installations explore the relationship between the human body and digital systems. Blending art with programming, her work invites viewers to become participants, using physical gestures to shape real-time visual and auditory environments.

In Dances of the Sacred and Profane, a collaboration with choreographer Mark Foehringer, Utterback merges live dance with generative projections and sound. Dancers’ movements are tracked and translated into fluid, molecular visuals that respond in real time, transforming choreography into an immersive digital landscape.

What draws me to this piece is how it treats the dancer’s body as both input and artwork. It’s not about control, but expression, turning data into emotion. The result feels poetic, even alive, showing how physical computing can create intimate, sensory-rich experiences. This aligns with my exploration for my own physical computing sketches, using technology to express movement, emotion, and presence. I’m inspired by the way she blurs the line between human gesture and digital form, and how interaction becomes a kind of storytelling.",./img/dancesofsacredandprofane.jpg,,"Dance of the Sacred and Profane, Camille Utterback",Seeing Voices is a series of AI images generated by the performance Voice In My Head.,https://camilleutterback.com/,#Physical Computing,

left,Ran Zhou,"HRI designer & researcher, China","Ran Zhou is a designer and researcher whose work explores the emotional and physical dimensions of human-computer interaction. Currently pursuing her PhD at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, she focuses on expressive haptics, soma design, and tangible interfaces. Her design approach often bridges technology and emotion, blending academic research with poetic, hands-on experimentation.

I’m particularly moved by her project Pat Me. This wearable robotic interface responds to gentle pats from the user by patting back, creating a cycle of mutual care. What stood out to me is how it challenges the idea of machines as passive tools. Instead, it frames interaction as something reciprocal. The robot only gives comfort if you initiate it, which adds emotional complexity and vulnerability to the exchange.

This project shifted how I think about interaction design. I often view it through a functional lens, but Pat Me reminds me that emotional depth and subtlety are equally powerful. I also admire how the project doesn’t try to eliminate loneliness, but instead acknowledges it and creates space for reflection. A simple touch becomes a meaningful gesture, made possible through thoughtful prototyping and research.",https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ranzhourobot.com%2Fpat-me-robot&psig=AOvVaw0jvu6i9s2g8IcUbmHhHsHt&ust=1747645875459000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCICyj6_WrI0DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE,,"Pat Me Robot, Ran Zhou",,https://www.ranzhourobot.com/,"#Physical Computing, #Concept",
